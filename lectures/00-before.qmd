## File Structure

-   Good file structure

    -   All project files in one main folder

    -   Subfolders (data, code, output)

-   Main folder is R project

    -   Self-contained project

    -   Use relative instead of absolute paths

-   Good folder & file names

    -   Descriptive but not too long

    -   No spaces

    -   Consistent format

## Data

-   Raw data

    -   In separate folder from cleaned data

    -   Never change!

    -   Each file should have metadata

## Code

-   Scripts with code

    -   Relative file paths to read in and create files

    -   Lots of comments

    -   Order: libraries, data, user-created functions, everything else

    -   Good variable & column names
