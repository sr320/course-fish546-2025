# Objectives

To get you repo in pristine condition and effectively present your research compendium via your rpubs page.

# Details

On Thursday you will be presenting your research project to the class. Everyone will have 10 minutes.

This presentation along with the rpubs compendium contents will be your Project Completion assignment grade.

This specific breakdown the Project Completion grade is as follows.

1)  Github repo with clear directory structure, files in proper directory, code files numbered in order. (25%)
2)  Rpubs page that has clear description of project at top targeting a general audience. (10%)
3)  Rpubs page that has clear workflow taking initial files to resulting finding (in figure format). Visualization (eg `head`) of intermediate files and simple access to ultimate findings (eg tables). (30%)
4)  Presentation to the class that follows logical, planned highlighting of content. Things to include are research problem, workflow, findings, implication of findings and next steps (35%)
