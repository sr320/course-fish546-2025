    "text": "Objectives\nLearn how to backup data and code so others can understand and your future self can understand.\n\n\nDocumenting and backing up code\nDocumenting and backing up code and data are crucial practices in genomics, data science, and other fields that involve programming or handling large amounts of data. Here’s why:\n\nTraceability and reproducibility: Clear documentation ensures that every piece of code, data, or computational process is traceable and reproducible. This is especially important when you want to replicate an analysis or experiment, debug an issue, or understand the progression and changes in the code or data over time.\nKnowledge sharing and collaboration: Documentation allows others to understand your work, making it easier for collaboration. It also enables knowledge transfer when team members change over time. Code without documentation is often useless to others and sometimes even to the person who originally wrote it after some time has passed.\nProfessionalism and quality assurance: Good documentation is a sign of professionalism and maturity in software development. It shows that the code or data has been well thought out and tested, and it allows for quality assurance processes such as code reviews and audits.\nDisaster recovery: Backups are essential for disaster recovery. If a server fails, or data gets corrupted, having a backup means you can restore the code or data and continue with minimal disruption. Backups also protect against accidental deletions and malicious actions.\n\nHere’s how to document and backup effectively:\n\nComment your code: Write clear comments in your code explaining what specific sections or lines of code are doing. Wherever possible, use self-explanatory variable and function names.\nWrite documentation: Use readme files, wikis, or similar resources to provide high-level documentation. This can include how to use and install the software, the structure of the code or data, known issues, and more. Tools like Doxygen or Javadoc can be helpful.\nUse version control systems: Tools like Git can track changes in code and help document the history and reasoning behind those changes. Git, in combination with platforms like GitHub, also allows you to back up your code online and collaborate with others.\nAutomate backups: Use automated tools to regularly back up your code and data. This could be a simple cron job that copies files to a different location, or more sophisticated solutions that can handle large datasets, such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or other data backup services.\nImplement a testing framework: This will serve as an additional form of documentation, explaining how the code is supposed to behave, and it provides a way to verify that changes to the code have not broken anything.\nUse data versioning tools: In case of data science projects, tools like DVC can be used to track changes in data and models over time, similar to how Git is used for code.\n\nDocumenting and backing up code and data are crucial practices in software development, data science, and other fields that involve programming or handling large amounts of data. Here’s why:\nRemember, good documentation and regular backups are not afterthoughts or luxuries—they’re essential components of professional, reliable, and resilient projects.\n\n\nArchiving a repo with Zenodo\nArchiving your GitHub repository with Zenodo allows you to have a digital object identifier (DOI) for your repo, which is useful for citing your software in academic papers. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n\nCreate a Zenodo account. You’ll need to visit Zenodo’s homepage (https://zenodo.org/) and sign up for an account if you don’t already have one.\nLink GitHub with Zenodo. After you’ve set up your Zenodo account, you can navigate to the “GitHub” section in the dashboard and link your GitHub account to Zenodo.\nAuthorize Zenodo on GitHub. Zenodo will request access to your GitHub repositories. You can either allow Zenodo to access all your repositories or only select ones. After you’ve made your choice, click “Authorize Zenodo.”\nSelect the repository. Back in Zenodo, you should see a list of all your GitHub repositories. You can choose to archive any repository by toggling the switch to “on” next to the repository name. Zenodo will now create a “webhook” for this repository, which will notify Zenodo whenever there is a new release of the repository on GitHub.\nCreate a new release on GitHub. If you haven’t done so already, you should create a new release of your repository on GitHub. Go to your repository page, click “releases” then “create a new release”. Tag version with the version number (for example “v1.0”) and add some description about this release. Zenodo will be notified once the release is published.\nCheck Zenodo for the deposit. After creating a new release, go back to Zenodo. You should see the new release in the “Upload” section. Zenodo automatically fills in some of the metadata for you, such as the title and authors, but you can edit this if needed.\nPublish the archive on Zenodo. Finally, you can publish the archive on Zenodo. Make sure all the information is correct, and then click the “Publish” button. Your repository is now archived, and you will have a DOI that you can use to cite your software.\n\nRemember that Zenodo will archive a new version of your repository every time you create a new release on GitHub, so it’s important to create meaningful and well-documented releases. Zenodo also allows you to link different versions of your software together, so that it’s clear how the software has changed over time."

In addition you will be carrying out an independent project throughout the quarter. Generally Tuesday will be learning a skillset and Thursday will be working on your independent project.\nEach student will have two GitHub repositories, one where you complete “classwork” and as one devoted to your project.

There will also be times when you have to run code outside of a GitHub repository. You will need to determine a way to effectively document this in your repository.\n\n\nComputers\nTo no surprise you will need to have some type of computer to do your analysis. This might seem trivial, but is not. In some instances you might you multiple machines. Generally speaking there are two primary consideration- RAM and CPUs (ie memory and power). Memory comes into play in running programs need to temporary store information like transcriptome assembly. Power is beneficial from programs that can use multiple CPUs. For example if hardware has 48 cores, it could run a program faster than one with 4 cores. Note there are a lot of nuances here but it is good to have this vocabulary. Some of the work takes a long time (even on big machines) - meaning hours to weeks, thus hardware access needs consideration.\nSome of the options you have are\n- your personal laptop - duration limited?\n- JupyterHub Instance - UW cloud machine, duration limited,\n- Roberts Lab Raven Rstudio server - cloud machine\n- Hyak Supercomputer - powerful - advanced interface\nFor simply typing (something that is also important) you can do this with almost anything with a keyboard. Note that GitHub will be the platform that allows you to move across machines.\n\nMost of the Assignments are designed to run on lightweight hardware, and we might want to try experience different platforms to see what works best for you. It is important to keep in mind that if you using multiple machines there is the possibility of causing git conflicts.\n\nOrganization and thought is important, particularly when it comes to this.\n\n\nWorking in the command-line\nHaving already reviewed the prep material and completed the bash tutorial you are now ready to get to coding.\nFor the first task you will take an unknown multi-fasta file and annotate it using blast. You are welcome to do this in terminal, Rstudio, or jupyter. My recommendation, and how I will demonstrate is using Rmarkdown. Once you have have your project structured, we will download software, databases, a fasta file and run the code.\nIn your code directory create a file.\n01-blast.Rmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRmarkdown is a good option as you can use markdown, add pictures and more!"

Use Markdown for formatting text, and R code chunks to insert code and results.\n\n\n\nyaml\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your Report Title\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"`r format(Sys.Date(), '%B %d, %Y')`\"\noutput: \n  html_document:\n    theme: readable\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\n    number_sections: true\n    code_folding: show\n---\n\nThis example uses the “readable” theme and includes a table of contents, numbered sections, and code folding options.\nOther themes include: “default”, “cerulean”, “journal”, “flatly”, “darkly”, “readable”, “spacelab”, “united”, “cosmo”, “lumen”, “paper”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “yeti”.\nCode highlights argument must be one of default, tango, pygments, kate, monochrome, espresso, zenburn, haddock, breezedark, textmate, arrow, or rstudio or a file with extension .theme.\n\nMarkdown text: Use Markdown syntax for text formatting (headings, lists, links, etc.).\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a sample report created using RMarkdown. You can add *italic*, **bold**, or [links](https://example.com).\n\n- Bullet point 1\n- Bullet point 2\n\nR code chunks: Insert R code and its output in your report using R code chunks.\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)\n```\n\n```{r example-plot}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata(mtcars)\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal()\n```\n\nCustomize the appearance: Use CSS, HTML widgets, or additional R packages to further enhance the visual appeal of your report.\n\n\nCustom CSS: Create a separate CSS file and link it in the YAML header.\nHTML widgets: Use packages like leaflet for maps, DT for tables, or plotly for interactive plots.\nAdditional R packages: Use packages like kableExtra for formatting tables, flexdashboard for dashboard layouts, or formattable for conditional formatting.\n\n\nRender the report: In RStudio, click the “Knit” button to generate the HTML output.\nShare the report: Host the generated HTML file on a web server, or use services like GitHub Pages or RStudio Connect to share your report with others.\n\nBy combining RMarkdown with the right formatting, customizations, and packages, you can create visually appealing, web-accessible reports that effectively communicate your insights and analyses.\n\n\nPractical Aspects\nI would recommend copying prior Rmd files and renaming them with the prefix 03.1, 03.2, etc depending on how many separate pages make sense for you.\nThe specific things I will be looking for this week include\n1. Addressing prior comments\n2. Explaining what code is doing\n3. Making output more easily understandable\n4. Adding unique visual features\n5. Generation of html report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou would want to only run (eval=TRUE) simple tasks in the knit, which is different than running chunk in Rmd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nBe careful about committing files, particularly those that are a result of cache. It is likely best to ignore those.\n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n3.1 Blast https://rpubs.com/sr320/1026094\n3.2 RNA-seq https://rpubs.com/sr320/1026190\nwhereas code is\n\nhttps://github.com/course-fish546-2023/steven-coursework/blob/main/assignments/code/3.1-blast.Rmd\nhttps://github.com/course-fish546-2023/steven-coursework/blob/main/assignments/code/3.2-dge.Rmd"

This could be “Terminal” within Rstudio, or a stand alone application.\nThe part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the file system. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called “folders”), which hold files or other directories.\nSeveral commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, let’s open a shell window:\nThe dollar sign is a prompt, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may show something more elaborate.\nType the command whoami, then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell. The command’s output is the ID of the current user, i.e., it shows us who the shell thinks we are:\nMore specifically, when we type whoami the shell:\nNext, let’s find out where we are by running a command called pwd (which stands for “print working directory”). At any moment, our current working directory is our current default directory, i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in unless we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer’s response is /home/jovyan\nTo understand what a “home directory” is, let’s have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized. At the top is the root directory that holds everything else. We refer to it using a slash character / on its own; this is the leading slash in /home/jovyan."

The names that don’t have trailing slashes, like notes.txt, pizza.cfg, and solar.pdf, are plain old files. And note that there is a space between ls and -F: without it, the shell thinks we’re trying to run a command called ls-F, which doesn’t exist."

Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work: it’s possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory, just as it’s possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, but it’s a self-defeating strategy.\nNotice, by the way that we spelled the directory name data. It doesn’t have a trailing slash: that’s added to directory names by ls when we use the -F flag to help us tell things apart.

    "text": "Nelle’s Pipeline: Organizing Files\nKnowing just this much about files and directories, Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create. First, she creates a directory called north-pacific-gyre (to remind herself where the data came from). Inside that, she creates a directory called 2012-07-03, which is the date she started processing the samples. She used to use names like conference-paper and revised-results, but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years. (The final straw was when she found herself creating a directory called revised-revised-results-3.)\n\nNelle names her directories “year-month-day”, with leading zeroes for months and days, because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order. If she used month names, December would come before July; if she didn’t use leading zeroes, November (‘11’) would come before July (‘7’).\n\nEach of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab’s convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as “NENE01729A”. This is what she used in her collection log to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so she decides to use it as part of each data file’s name. Since the assay machine’s output is plain text, she will call her files NENE01729A.txt, NENE01812A.txt, and so on. All 1520 files will go into the same directory.\nIf she is in her home directory, Nelle can see what files she has using the command:\nls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/\nThis is a lot to type, but she can let the shell do most of the work. If she types:\nls nor\nand then presses tab, the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:\nls north-pacific-gyre/\nIf she presses tab again, Bash will add 2012-07-03/ to the command, since it’s the only possible completion. Pressing tab again does nothing, since there are 1520 possibilities; pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files, and so on. This is called tab completion, and we will see it in many other tools as we go on."

It matches zero or more characters, so *.pdb matches ethane.pdb, propane.pdb, and so on. On the other hand, p*.pdb only matches pentane.pdb and propane.pdb, because the ‘p’ at the front only matches itself.\n? is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This means that p?.pdb matches pi.pdb or p5.pdb, but not propane.pdb. We can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, p*.p?* matches anything that starts with a ‘p’ and ends with ‘.’, ‘p’, and at least one more character (since the ‘?’ has to match one character, and the final * can match any number of characters). Thus, p*.p?* would match preferred.practice, and even p.pi (since the first * can match no characters at all), but not quality.practice (doesn’t start with ‘p’) or preferred.p (there isn’t at least one character after the ‘.p’).\nWhen the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the command that was asked for. This means that commands like wc and ls never see the wildcard characters, just what those wildcards matched. This is another example of orthogonal design.\nIf we run wc -l instead of just wc, the output shows only the number of lines per file:\nwc -l *.pdb\n  20  cubane.pdb\n  12  ethane.pdb\n   9  methane.pdb\n  30  octane.pdb\n  21  pentane.pdb\n  15  propane.pdb\n 107  total\nWe can also use -w to get only the number of words, or -c to get only the number of characters."

    "text": "pipe\nIf you think this is confusing, you’re in good company: even once you understand what wc, sort, and head do, all those intermediate files make it hard to follow what’s going on. We can make it easier to understand by running sort and head together:\nsort -n lengths | head -1\n  9  methane.pdb\nThe vertical bar between the two commands is called a pipe. It tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left as the input to the command on the right. The computer might create a temporary file if it needs to, or copy data from one program to the other in memory, or something else entirely; we don’t have to know or care.\nWe can use another pipe to send the output of wc directly to sort, which then sends its output to head:\nwc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -1\n  9  methane.pdb\n\nHere’s what actually happens behind the scenes when we create a pipe. When a computer runs a program—any program—it creates a process in memory to hold the program’s software and its current state. Every process has an input channel called standard input. (By this point, you may be surprised that the name is so memorable, but don’t worry: most Unix programmers call it “stdin”. Every process also has a default output channel called standard output] (or “stdout”)\n\n\nThe shell is actually just another program. Under normal circumstances, whatever we type on the keyboard is sent to the shell on its standard input, and whatever it produces on standard output is displayed on our screen. When we tell the shell to run a program, it creates a new process and temporarily sends whatever we type on our keyboard to that process’s standard input, and whatever the process sends to standard output to the screen.\nHere’s what happens when we run wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths. The shell starts by telling the computer to create a new process to run the wc program. Since we’ve provided some filenames as parameters, wc reads from them instead of from standard input. And since we’ve used &gt; to redirect output to a file, the shell connects the process’s standard output to that file.\nIf we run wc -l *.pdb | sort -n instead, the shell creates two processes (one for each process in the pipe) so that wc and sort run simultaneously. The standard output of wc is fed directly to the standard input of sort; since there’s no redirection with &gt;, sort’s output goes to the screen. And if we run wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -1, we get three processes with data flowing from the files, through wc to sort, and from sort through head to the screen.\nThis simple idea is why Unix has been so successful. Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things, Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well, and that work well with each other. This programming model is called pipes and filters. We’ve already seen pipes; a filter is a program like wc or sort that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output. Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way: unless told to do otherwise, they read from standard input, do something with what they’ve read, and write to standard output.\nThe key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input and writes lines of text to standard output can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well. You can and should write your programs this way so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.\n\n\nRedirecting Input\nAs well as using &gt; to redirect a program’s output, we can use &lt; to redirect its input, i.e., to read from a file instead of from standard input. For example, instead of writing wc ammonia.pdb, we could write wc &lt; ammonia.pdb. In the first case, wc gets a command line parameter telling it what file to open. In the second, wc doesn’t have any command line parameters, so it reads from standard input, but we have told the shell to send the contents of ammonia.pdb to wc’s standard input."

This system is commonly used in most biological research, including genome annotations in databases such as GenBank and Ensembl.\n0-based coordinate system: In this system, the first base of a sequence is numbered as 0. This system is commonly used in some computational tools and languages, like Python and in the BED file format widely used in bioinformatics.\n\nThe distinction between 1-based and 0-based is important because it can lead to off-by-one errors if not accounted for.\nGenomicRanges Package:\nIn the R programming language, the GenomicRanges package is often used for handling genomic ranges. It provides a convenient and consistent way to handle and manipulate genomic ranges. Some of the functionalities include:\n\nCreating genomic ranges\nFinding overlaps between genomic ranges\nFinding the nearest genomic range\nShifting or narrowing genomic ranges\n\nHere’s a basic example of how you can create a GenomicRange object in R:\n# Loading the library\nlibrary(GenomicRanges)\n\n# Creating a GenomicRanges object\ngr &lt;- GRanges(seqnames = \"chr1\", \n              ranges = IRanges(start = c(100, 200), end = c(150, 250)))\n\n# Printing the object\nprint(gr)\nUnderstanding genomic ranges and coordinate systems is crucial when dealing with any kind of genomic data, as it allows precise representation and manipulation of genomic features. Be sure to always check the documentation of any tool or database you’re using to understand what kind of coordinate system it uses, and always be consistent in your own work.\n\n\nBEDTools:\nBEDTools is a suite of utilities for comparing and manipulating genomic features in various formats such as BED, GFF/GTF, VCF, and BAM. These tools are incredibly powerful for handling genomic intervals and are often used in bioinformatics pipelines. Some of its features include:\n\nComparing genomic features\nManipulating genomic features\nCounting genomic features\nCreating coverage tracks\n\nHere’s a basic rundown of some of the most commonly used BEDTools subcommands:\n\nintersect\nbedtools intersect is used to find overlapping regions between two BED files. For example, you could use it to find genes (from a genes.BED file) that overlap with regulatory regions (from a regulatory_regions.BED file):\nbedtools intersect -a genes.BED -b regulatory_regions.BED\nmerge\nbedtools merge combines overlapping intervals into a single interval. For example, if you have a BED file with multiple overlapping regions, you can merge them into single, continuous regions:\nbedtools merge -i input.BED\nsort\nbedtools sort sorts a BED file by chromosome and then by start position. This is often necessary before using other BEDTools commands, as many require sorted input:\nbedtools sort -i input.BED\nclosest\nbedtools closest finds the closest non-overlapping interval. For example, for each gene (in genes.BED), you could find the closest regulatory region (in regulatory_regions.BED):\nbedtools closest -a genes.BED -b regulatory_regions.BED\ncoverage\nbedtools coverage calculates the coverage of one set of intervals over another. For example, you could calculate the coverage of sequencing reads (in reads.BED) over genes (in genes.BED):\nbedtools coverage -a genes.BED -b reads.BED\n\nLastly, BEDTools is flexible and powerful, but it can be complex. Always check the documentation and test your commands on small, controlled datasets to make sure they’re doing what you expect."

    "text": "SNPs in RNA-seq data\nFinding SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in RNA-seq data is an essential step in understanding genetic variation and its effects on gene expression. Here is a summary of the process:\n\nQuality control and preprocessing: Start by assessing the quality of your raw RNA-seq reads using tools like FastQC. Trim low-quality bases and adapter sequences using software like Trimmomatic or Cutadapt to ensure accurate downstream analysis.\nAlignment: Align the cleaned RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using a spliced aligner like STAR, HISAT2, or TopHat2. These tools can handle the intron-exon structure of RNA-seq data and provide accurate alignments.\nSort and index alignments: Use SAMtools or Picard to convert the alignment output (SAM) to a binary format (BAM), sort, and index the aligned reads for efficient data processing.\nVariant calling: Employ a variant caller such as GATK’s HaplotypeCaller, SAMtools mpileup, or FreeBayes to identify SNPs and other genetic variants in your RNA-seq data. These tools use statistical models to call SNPs based on the differences observed between aligned reads and the reference genome.\nFiltering: Apply quality filters to remove low-confidence variant calls. Use tools like GATK’s VariantFiltration or BCFtools filter to set quality thresholds based on parameters like depth, quality score, strand bias, and mapping quality.\nAnnotation: Annotate the filtered SNPs using software like ANNOVAR, SnpEff, or VEP to gain insights into their potential functional effects on genes, transcripts, and proteins.\nDownstream analysis: Investigate the potential impact of SNPs on gene expression, alternative splicing, or allele-specific expression using tools like DESeq2, edgeR, or Cufflinks.\n\nRemember that this is only a general summary and specific steps might vary depending on the organism, reference genome, and experimental conditions. Always consult the documentation of the chosen tools and follow best practices for RNA-seq data analysis."

    "section": "Reciprocal BLAST",
    "text": "Reciprocal BLAST\nA reciprocal BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis is a technique used to identify homologous genes or proteins between two species by performing a BLAST search in both directions. In other words, it involves searching for similarities between a query sequence from species A against a database of sequences from species B, and then searching for similarities between a query sequence from species B against a database of sequences from species A. This approach helps confirm orthology, which is useful in comparative genomics and evolutionary studies.\nThree insightful visualizations of reciprocal BLAST analysis results could be:\n\nCircos Plot: A Circos plot is a circular layout that can display relationships between genomic sequences. In the context of reciprocal BLAST analysis, a Circos plot can effectively illustrate orthologous relationships between two species by connecting homologous genes or proteins with lines or curves. The strength of the connection (e.g., based on similarity scores or e-values) can be represented by the width or color of the lines, providing a comprehensive overview of the conservation between the two genomes.\nHeatmap: A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values are represented by colors. In a reciprocal BLAST analysis, a heatmap can be used to visualize the similarity scores or e-values between pairs of orthologous genes or proteins. The rows and columns of the heatmap would represent genes or proteins from species A and species B, respectively, with the color intensity representing the strength of the orthologous relationship. This allows for easy identification of strongly conserved regions or potential functional similarities between the two species.\nScatter Plot with Dot Matrix: A scatter plot with dot matrix can visualize the distribution of reciprocal best hits (RBH) based on similarity scores or e-values. The x-axis would represent the scores or e-values for species A against species B, and the y-axis would represent the scores or e-values for species B against species A. Each dot on the plot would represent a pair of orthologs, with its position determined by the score or e-value in both directions. This visualization allows users to identify potential outliers, observe the overall correlation between the two species, and assess the quality of the reciprocal BLAST analysis results."
