## Assignment

Archive your research repo with Zenodo AND rsync to another computer.
:::

This week you will use Zenodo to archive your repo. See [these instructions](https://sr320.github.io/course-fish546-2023/lectures/09-project.html). Add the DOI from zenondo to your rpubs website.

We have used `rsync` in week 04. Use it this week to backup your entire directory on raven to another computer. In your code directory create a shell script named 00-rsync.sh with the rsync code used to backup your repo.
