First, she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre` (to remind herself where the data came from). Inside that, she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`, which is the date she started processing the samples. She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`, but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years. (The final straw was when she found herself creating a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)\n",

If she used month names, December would come before July; if she didn't use leading zeroes, November ('11') would come before July ('7').\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as \"NENE01729A\". This is what she used in her collection log to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name. Since the assay machine's output is plain text, she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on. All 1520 files will go into the same directory.\n",
        "\n",

Thus, `p*.p?*` would match `preferred.practice`, and even `p.pi` (since the first `*` can match no characters at all), but not `quality.practice` (doesn't start with 'p') or `preferred.p` (there isn't at least one character after the '.p').\n",

And since we've used `>` to redirect output to a file, the shell connects the process's standard output to that file.\n",
        ">\n",

The standard output of `wc` is fed directly to the standard input of `sort`; since there's no redirection with `>`, `sort`'s output goes to the screen. And if we run `wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -1`, we get three processes with data flowing from the files, through `wc` to `sort`, and from `sort` through `head` to the screen.\n",

        "> This simple idea is why Unix has been so successful. Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things, Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well, and that work well with each other. This programming model is called [pipes and filters](../../gloss.html#pipe-and-filter). We've already seen pipes; a [filter](../../gloss.html#filter) is a program like `wc` or `sort` that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output. Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way: unless told to do otherwise, they read from standard input, do something with what they've read, and write to standard output.\n",

In the second, `wc` doesn't have any command line parameters, so it reads from standard input, but we have told the shell to send the contents of `ammonia.pdb` to `wc`'s standard input.\n",
