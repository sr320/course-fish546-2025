For this self directed tutorial you will need to download [data-shell.zip](https://d.pr/f/BDaGTy) and navigate to using a terminal. This could be "Terminal" within Rstudio, or a stand alone application.
Also available @ `http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/data-shell.zip`
:::

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the **file system**. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called "folders"), which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, let's open a shell window:

``` bash
$
```

The dollar sign is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may show something more elaborate.

Type the command `whoami`, then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell. The command's output is the ID of the current user, i.e., it shows us who the shell thinks we are:

``` bash
whoami
```

More specifically, when we type `whoami` the shell:

1.  finds a program called `whoami`,
2.  runs that program,
3.  displays that program's output, then
4.  displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

Next, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd` (which stands for "print working directory"). At any moment, our **current working directory** is our current default directory, i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in unless we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer's response is `/home/jovyan`

``` bash
pwd
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To understand what a "home directory" is, let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized. At the top is the **root directory** that holds everything else. We refer to it using a slash character `/` on its own; this is the leading slash in `/home/jovyan`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: callout-note
There are two meanings for the \`/\` character. When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory. When it appears \*inside\* a name, it's just a separator.
:::

::: callout-warning
So that we have the same experience navigate to the 'data-shell' directory.
:::

## ls

Let's see what's in this directory by running `ls`, which stands for "listing":

``` bash
ls
```

```         
creatures  molecules           pizza.cfg
data       north-pacific-gyre  solar.pdf
Desktop    notes.txt           writing
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sr320/course-fish274-2021/main/docs/img/ls-image.png" alt="Nelle&apos;s Home Directory"/>

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns. We can make its output more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`, which tells `ls` to add a trailing `/` to the names of directories:

``` bash
ls -F
```

```         
creatures/  molecules/           pizza.cfg
data/       north-pacific-gyre/  solar.pdf
Desktop/    notes.txt            writing/
```

Here, we can see that `data-shell` contains seven **sub-directories**. The names that don't have trailing slashes, like `notes.txt`, `pizza.cfg`, and `solar.pdf`, are plain old files. And note that there is a space between `ls` and `-F`: without it, the shell thinks we're trying to run a command called `ls-F`, which doesn't exist.

## relative path

Now let's take a look at what's in `data-shell` directory by running `ls -F data`, i.e., the command `ls` with the **arguments** `-F` and `data`. The second argument --- the one *without* a leading dash --- tells `ls` that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

``` bash
 ls -F data
```

```         
amino-acids.txt  animal-counts/  animals.txt  elements/  morse.txt  pdb/  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt
```

The output shows us that there are four text files and two sub-sub-directories. Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work: it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory, just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, but it's a self-defeating strategy.

Notice, by the way that we spelled the directory name `data`. It doesn't have a trailing slash: that's added to directory names by `ls` when we use the `-F` flag to help us tell things apart. And it doesn't begin with a slash because it's a **relative path**, i.e., it tells `ls` how to find something from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.

## absolute path

If we run `ls -F /data` (*with* a leading slash) we get a different answer, because `/data` is an **absolute path**:

``` bash
ls -F /data
```

**Note** you will get an "No file" warning here. This is because we this directory does not exist.

The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the filesystem, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.

If we wanted to use the \*\*absolute path\* to list out the contents of this directory we could used

``` bash
ls -F /home/jovyan/data-shell/data/
```

Note this would work no matter what our pwd is.

## Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing just this much about files and directories, Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create. First, she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre` (to remind herself where the data came from). Inside that, she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`, which is the date she started processing the samples. She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`, but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years. (The final straw was when she found herself creating a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

> Nelle names her directories "year-month-day", with leading zeroes for months and days, because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order. If she used month names, December would come before July; if she didn't use leading zeroes, November ('11') would come before July ('7').

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as "NENE01729A". This is what she used in her collection log to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name. Since the assay machine's output is plain text, she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on. All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

If she is in her home directory, Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

``` bash
ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
```

This is a lot to type, but she can let the shell do most of the work. If she types:

``` bash
ls nor
```

and then presses tab, the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

``` bash
ls north-pacific-gyre/
```

If she presses tab again, Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command, since it's the only possible completion. Pressing tab again does nothing, since there are 1520 possibilities; pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files, and so on. This is called **tab completion**, and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.

## Key Points

-   The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
-   Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
-   Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
-   `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole filesystem.
-   A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
-   An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the filesystem.
-   Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\` on Windows.
-   `..` means "the directory above the current one"; `.` on its own means "the current directory".
-   Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
-   Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a `-`.

# Creating Things

#### Objectives

-   Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.
-   Create files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files.
-   Display the contents of a directory using the command line.
-   Delete specified files and/or directories.

We now know how to explore files and directories, but how do we create them in the first place? Let's go back to `data-shell`, and use `ls -F` to see what it contains:

``` bash
ls -F
```

```         
creatures/  molecules/           pizza.cfg
data/       north-pacific-gyre/  solar.pdf
Desktop/    notes.txt            writing/
```

Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis` (which has no output):

``` bash
mkdir thesis
```

As you might (or might not) guess from its name, `mkdir` means "make directory". Since `thesis` is a relative path (i.e., doesn't have a leading slash), the new directory is made below the current working directory:

``` bash
ls -F
```

```         
creatures/  north-pacific-gyre/  thesis/
data/       notes.txt            writing/
Desktop/    pizza.cfg
molecules/  solar.pdf
```

However, there's nothing in it yet:

``` bash
ls -F thesis
```

Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`, then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

``` bash
cd thesis
nano draft.txt
```

#### Which Editor?

When we say, "`nano` is a text editor," we really do mean "text": it can only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other human-friendly media. We use it in examples because almost anyone can drive it anywhere without training, but please use something more powerful for real work. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X), many programmers use [Emacs](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc) or [Vim](http://sophieclayton.github.io/img/software-carpentry-banner.png) (both of which are completely unintuitive, even by Unix standards), or a graphical editor such as [Gedit](http://software-carpentry.org "Software Carpentry"). On Windows, you may wish to use [Notepad++](../../gloss.html#wildcard). On a Mac, [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) is an option.

No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you "Save As..."

Let's type in a few lines of text, then use **Control-O** to write our data to disk:

![Nano in Action](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/cnidarian/skitch/Creating_Things_1A576087.png)

Once our file is saved, we can use **Control-X** to quit the editor and return to the shell. (Unix documentation often uses the shorthand `^A` to mean "control-A".) `nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits, but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

``` bash
ls
```

```         
draft.txt
```

Let's tidy up by running `rm draft.txt`:

``` bash
rm draft.txt
```

This command removes files ("rm" is short for "remove"). If we run `ls` again, its output is empty once more, which tells us that our file is gone:

``` bash
ls
```

#### Deleting Is Forever

Unix doesn't have a trash bin: when we delete files, they are unhooked from the file system so that their storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and recovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll work in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the file's disk space right away.

```{=html}
<!--
Let's re-create that file and then move up one directory to `/users/nelle` using `cd ..`:

    $ pwd

    /users/nelle/thesis

    $ nano draft.txt
    $ ls

    draft.txt

    $ cd ..

If we try to remove the entire `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`, we get an error message:

    $ rm thesis

    rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory

This happens because `rm` only works on files, not directories. The right command is `rmdir`, which is short for "remove directory". It doesn't work yet either, though, because the directory we're trying to remove isn't empty:

    $ rmdir thesis

    rmdir: failed to remove `thesis': Directory not empty

This little safety feature can save you a lot of grief, particularly if you are a bad typist. To really get rid of `thesis` we must first delete the file `draft.txt`:

    $ rm thesis/draft.txt

The directory is now empty, so `rmdir` can delete it:

    $ rmdir thesis

&gt; #### With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
&gt;
&gt; Removing the files in a directory just so that we can remove the directory quickly becomes tedious. Instead, we can use `rm` with the `-r` flag (which stands for "recursive"):
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     $ rm -r thesis
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This removes everything in the directory, then the directory itself. If the directory contains sub-directories, `rm -r` does the same thing to them, and so on. It's very handy, but can do a lot of damage if used without care.

Let's create that directory and file one more time. (Note that this time we're running `nano` with the path `thesis/draft.txt`, rather than going into the `thesis` directory and running `nano` on `draft.txt` there.)

    $ pwd

    /users/nelle

    $ mkdir thesis

    $ nano thesis/draft.txt
    $ ls thesis

    draft.txt

`draft.txt` isn't a particularly informative name, so let's change the file's name using `mv`, which is short for "move":

    $ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt

The first parameter tells `mv` what we're "moving", while the second is where it's to go. In this case, we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`, which has the same effect as renaming the file. Sure enough, `ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

    $ ls thesis

    quotes.txt

Just for the sake of inconsistency, `mv` also works on directories—there is no separate `mvdir` command.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory. We use `mv` once again, but this time we'll just use the name of a directory as the second parameter to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename, but put the file somewhere new. (This is why the command is called "move".) In this case, the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

    $ mv thesis/quotes.txt .

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory. `ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

    $ ls thesis

Further, `ls` with a filename or directory name as a parameter only lists that file or directory. We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is still in our current directory:

    $ ls quotes.txt

    quotes.txt

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`, except it copies a file instead of moving it. We can check that it did the right thing using `ls` with two paths as parameters—like most Unix commands, `ls` can be given thousands of paths at once:

    $ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
    $ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt

    quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt

To prove that we made a copy, let's delete the `quotes.txt` file in the current directory and then run that same `ls` again. This time it tells us that it can't find `quotes.txt` in the current directory, but it does find the copy in `thesis` that we didn't delete:

    $ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt

    ls: cannot access quotes.txt: No such file or directory
    thesis/quotations.txt

&gt; #### Another Useful Abbreviation
&gt;
&gt; The shell interprets the character `~` (tilde) at the start of a path to mean "the current user's home directory". For example, if Nelle's home directory is `/home/nelle`, then `~/data` is equivalent to `/home/nelle/data`. This only works if it is the first character in the path: `here/there/~/elsewhere` is _not_ `/home/nelle/elsewhere`.

#### Key Points

* Unix documentation uses '^A' to mean "control-A".
* The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.
* Nano is a very simple text editor—please use something else for real work.

What is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?

    $ pwd
    /home/jamie/data
    $ ls
    proteins.dat
    $ mkdir recombine
    $ mv proteins.dat recombine
    $ cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
    $ ls

Suppose that:

    $ ls -F
    analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat

What command(s) could you run so that the commands below will produce the output shown?

    $ ls
    analyzed   raw
    $ ls analyzed
    fructose.dat    sucrose.dat

What does `cp` do when given several filenames and a directory name, as in:

    $ mkdir backup
    $ cp thesis/citations.txt thesis/quotations.txt backup

What does `cp` do when given three or more filenames, as in:

    $ ls -F
    intro.txt    methods.txt    survey.txt
    $ cp intro.txt methods.txt survey.txt

The command `ls -R` lists the contents of directories recursively, i.e., lists their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on in alphabetical order at each level. The command `ls -t` lists things by time of last change, with most recently changed files or directories first. In what order does `ls -R -t` display things?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pipes and Filters

#### Objectives

-   Redirect a command's output to a file.
-   Process a file instead of keyboard input using redirection.
-   Construct command pipelines with two or more stages.
-   Explain what usually happens if a program or pipeline isn't given any input to process.
-   Explain Unix's "small pieces, loosely joined" philosophy.

Now that we know a few basic commands, we can finally look at the shell's most powerful feature: the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways. We'll start with a directory called `molecules` that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules. The `.pdb` extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format, a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.

``` bash
ls molecules
```

```         
cubane.pdb    ethane.pdb    methane.pdb
octane.pdb    pentane.pdb   propane.pdb
```

## word count

Let's go into that directory with `cd` and run the command `wc *.pdb`. `wc` is the "word count" command: it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files. The `*` in `*.pdb` matches zero or more characters, so the shell turns `*.pdb` into a complete list of `.pdb` files:

``` bash
cd molecules
```

```         
$ wc *.pdb

  20  156 1158 cubane.pdb
  12   84  622 ethane.pdb
   9   57  422 methane.pdb
  30  246 1828 octane.pdb
  21  165 1226 pentane.pdb
  15  111  825 propane.pdb
 107  819 6081 total
```

### Wildcards

`*` is a [wildcard](../../gloss.html#wildcard). It matches zero or more characters, so `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and so on. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only matches itself.

`?` is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This means that `p?.pdb` matches `pi.pdb` or `p5.pdb`, but not `propane.pdb`. We can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, `p*.p?*` matches anything that starts with a 'p' and ends with '.', 'p', and at least one more character (since the '?' has to match one character, and the final `*` can match any number of characters). Thus, `p*.p?*` would match `preferred.practice`, and even `p.pi` (since the first `*` can match no characters at all), but not `quality.practice` (doesn't start with 'p') or `preferred.p` (there isn't at least one character after the '.p').

When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was asked for. This means that commands like `wc` and `ls` never see the wildcard characters, just what those wildcards matched. This is another example of orthogonal design.

If we run `wc -l` instead of just `wc`, the output shows only the number of lines per file:

``` bash
wc -l *.pdb
```

```         
  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total
```

We can also use `-w` to get only the number of words, or `-c` to get only the number of characters.

## redirect

Which of these files is shortest? It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files, but what if there were 6000? Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:

``` bash
wc -l *.pdb > lengths
```

The `>` tells the shell to redirect the command's output to a file instead of printing it to the screen. The shell will create the file if it doesn't exist, or overwrite the contents of that file if it does. (This is why there is no screen output: everything that `wc` would have printed has gone into the file `lengths` instead.) `ls lengths` confirms that the file exists:

``` bash
ls lengths
```

```         
lengths
```

## cat

We can now send the content of `lengths` to the screen using `cat lengths`. `cat` stands for "concatenate": it prints the contents of files one after another. There's only one file in this case, so `cat` just shows us what it contains:

``` bash
cat lengths
```

```         
  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total
```

## sort

Now let's use the `sort` command to sort its contents. We will also use the -n flag to specify that the sort is numerical instead of alphabetical. This does *not* change the file; instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:

``` bash
sort -n lengths
```

```         
  9  methane.pdb
 12  ethane.pdb
 15  propane.pdb
 20  cubane.pdb
 21  pentane.pdb
 30  octane.pdb
107  total
```

## head

We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called `sorted-lengths` by putting `> sorted-lengths` after the command, just as we used `> lengths` to put the output of `wc` into `lengths`. Once we've done that, we can run another command called `head` to get the first few lines in `sorted-lengths`:

``` bash
sort -n lengths > sorted-lengths
head -1 sorted-lengths
```

```         
  9  methane.pdb
```

Using the parameter `-1` with `head` tells it that we only want the first line of the file; `-20` would get the first 20, and so on. Since `sorted-lengths` contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest, the output of `head` must be the file with the fewest lines.

## pipe

If you think this is confusing, you're in good company: even once you understand what `wc`, `sort`, and `head` do, all those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on. We can make it easier to understand by running `sort` and `head` together:

``` bash
sort -n lengths | head -1
```

```         
  9  methane.pdb
```

The vertical bar between the two commands is called a [pipe](../../gloss.html#pipe). It tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left as the input to the command on the right. The computer might create a temporary file if it needs to, or copy data from one program to the other in memory, or something else entirely; we don't have to know or care.

We can use another pipe to send the output of `wc` directly to `sort`, which then sends its output to `head`:

``` bash
wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -1
```

```         
  9  methane.pdb
```

> Here's what actually happens behind the scenes when we create a pipe. When a computer runs a program---any program---it creates a process in memory to hold the program's software and its current state. Every process has an input channel called standard input. (By this point, you may be surprised that the name is so memorable, but don't worry: most Unix programmers call it "stdin". Every process also has a default output channel called standard output\] (or "stdout")

> The shell is actually just another program. Under normal circumstances, whatever we type on the keyboard is sent to the shell on its standard input, and whatever it produces on standard output is displayed on our screen. When we tell the shell to run a program, it creates a new process and temporarily sends whatever we type on our keyboard to that process's standard input, and whatever the process sends to standard output to the screen.
>
> Here's what happens when we run `wc -l *.pdb > lengths`. The shell starts by telling the computer to create a new process to run the `wc` program. Since we've provided some filenames as parameters, `wc` reads from them instead of from standard input. And since we've used `>` to redirect output to a file, the shell connects the process's standard output to that file.
>
> If we run `wc -l *.pdb | sort -n` instead, the shell creates two processes (one for each process in the pipe) so that `wc` and `sort` run simultaneously. The standard output of `wc` is fed directly to the standard input of `sort`; since there's no redirection with `>`, `sort`'s output goes to the screen. And if we run `wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -1`, we get three processes with data flowing from the files, through `wc` to `sort`, and from `sort` through `head` to the screen.
>
> This simple idea is why Unix has been so successful. Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things, Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well, and that work well with each other. This programming model is called pipes and filters. We've already seen pipes; a filter is a program like `wc` or `sort` that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output. Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way: unless told to do otherwise, they read from standard input, do something with what they've read, and write to standard output.
>
> The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input and writes lines of text to standard output can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well. You can *and should* write your programs this way so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.

#### Redirecting Input

As well as using `>` to redirect a program's output, we can use `<` to redirect its input, i.e., to read from a file instead of from standard input. For example, instead of writing `wc ammonia.pdb`, we could write `wc < ammonia.pdb`. In the first case, `wc` gets a command line parameter telling it what file to open. In the second, `wc` doesn't have any command line parameters, so it reads from standard input, but we have told the shell to send the contents of `ammonia.pdb` to `wc`'s standard input.

# Nelle's Pipeline: Checking Files

Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines and created 1520 files in the `north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03` directory described earlier. As a quick sanity check, she types:

``` bash
cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
wc -l *.txt
```

The output is 1520 lines that look like this:

```         
300 NENE01729A.txt
300 NENE01729B.txt
300 NENE01736A.txt
300 NENE01751A.txt
300 NENE01751B.txt
300 NENE01812A.txt
... ...
```

Now she types this:

``` bash
wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -5
```

```         
 240 NENE02018B.txt
 300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt
```

Whoops: one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others. When she goes back and checks it, she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning---someone was probably in using the machine on the weekend, and she forgot to reset it. Before re-running that sample, she checks to see if any files have too much data:

``` bash
wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -5
```

```         
 300 NENE02040A.txt
 300 NENE02040B.txt
 300 NENE02040Z.txt
 300 NENE02043A.txt
 300 NENE02043B.txt
```

Those numbers look good---but what's that 'Z' doing there in the third-to-last line? All of her samples should be marked 'A' or 'B'; by convention, her lab uses 'Z' to indicate samples with missing information. To find others like it, she does this:

``` bash
ls *Z.txt
```

```         
NENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt
```

Sure enough, when she checks the log on her laptop, there's no depth recorded for either of those samples. Since it's too late to get the information any other way, she must exclude those two files from her analysis. She could just delete them using `rm`, but there are actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn't matter, so instead, she'll just be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expression `*[AB].txt`. As always, the `*` matches any number of characters; the expression `[AB]` matches either an 'A' or a 'B', so this matches all the valid data files she has.

#### Key Points

-   `command > file` redirects a command's output to a file.
-   `first | second` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.
-   The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).

<!--
If we run `sort` on this file:

    10
    2
    19
    22
    6

the output is:

    10
    19
    2
    22
    6

If we run `sort -n` on the same input, we get this instead:

    2
    6
    10
    19
    22

Explain why `-n` has this effect.

What is the difference between:

    wc -l < mydata.dat

and:

    wc -l mydata.dat

The command `uniq` removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input. For example, if a file `salmon.txt` contains:

    coho
    coho
    steelhead
    coho
    steelhead
    steelhead

then `uniq salmon.txt` produces:

    coho
    steelhead
    coho
    steelhead

Why do you think `uniq` only removes _adjacent_ duplicated lines? (Hint: think about very large data sets.) What other command could you combine with it in a pipe to remove all duplicated lines?

A file called `animals.txt` contains the following data:

    2012-11-05,deer
    2012-11-05,rabbit
    2012-11-05,raccoon
    2012-11-06,rabbit
    2012-11-06,deer
    2012-11-06,fox
    2012-11-07,rabbit
    2012-11-07,bear

What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below?

    cat animals.txt | head -5 | tail -3 | sort -r &gt; final.txt

The command:

    $ cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt

produces the following output:

    deer
    rabbit
    raccoon
    rabbit
    deer
    fox
    rabbit
    bear

What other command(s) could be added to this in a pipeline to find out what animals the file contains (without any duplicates in their names)?
